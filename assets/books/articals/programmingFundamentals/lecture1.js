      <h2>So what is a Computer?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>
      A computer is a versatile electronic device that performs tasks based on
      instructions.

      <div class="question">
      <h2>Okay, Examples?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>Here are the examples of computer:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Smart TVs</li>
      <li>Smart Refrigerators</li>
      <li>Smart Washing Machines</li>
      <li>Smartwatches</li>
      <li>Fitness Trackers</li>
      <li>Digital Cameras</li>
      <li>Desktop</li>
      <li>Laptop</li>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="question">
      <h2>Why we need to write programs?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>
      Ammm... The truth is that they are dumb. We need to program computers
      because, without instructions, they donâ€™t know what to do. Programming
      lets us tell computers how to perform specific tasks, solve problems,
      and respond to commands, making them useful in everyday life.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      <h2>Example?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>
      Here's a simple analogy:** Imagine a computer as a chef. You provide the
      chef with a recipe (the program), and the chef follows the instructions
      to create the desired dish (the output).
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      <h2>Interesting! How to program them?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>
      So... You are Interested okay! lets see what we can do! So first of all
      we need you learn the things
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      <h2>What are these things?ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Algorithm</li>
      <li>FlowChart</li>
      <li>Program</li>
      </ul>
      <button><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9ASKAni_s&t=77s">Video on Algorithm/Program</a></button>
      <p>
      Algorithms are the blueprints. Flowcharts are the sketches. Programs are
      the actual buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
      An algorithm is the abstract concept of a solution. A flowchart is a
        visual representation of the algorithm. A program is the concrete
        implementation of the algorithm in a programming language.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
        <h2>Example?ðŸ¤”</h2>
        <p>Here is how the algorithm of adding two numbers would look like</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Input first number as P</li>
        <li>Step 2: Input second number as Q</li>
        <li>Step 3: Set Sum=P+Q</li>
        <li>Step 4: Print Sum</li>
        <li>Step 5: End</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the flowchart for the same operation.</p>
        <img src=${images.lecture1FlowCharToAddTwoNumbersImage} alt="FlowChart to add two numbers">
        <p>And here is the program to write the program for the same purpose in python.</p>
        <code>
        <p>P = float(input("Enter first number (P): "))</p>
        <p>Q = float(input("Enter second number (Q): "))</p>
        <p>Sum = P + Q</p>
        <p>print("The sum is:", Sum)</p>

        </code>
        </div>
        
      <p class="note">You don't need to master them all specifically the code part that would be done in latter class for now take the concept only</p>
